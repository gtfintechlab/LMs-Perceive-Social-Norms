**Explanation:**

While the vast majority of people would agree that exchanging money for sexual photos is generally wrong, the context of marriage makes this a bit more nuanced.  

* **Common Belief:** The expectation of fidelity and trust in a marriage would lead most people to believe that such behavior is unacceptable. 
* **Not Universal:** However, there might be small segments of the population with different relationship models (open relationships, ethical non-monogamy) where this behavior might be acceptable with consent.  

Therefore, while not universally agreed upon, it's a common belief shared by a large majority.

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Individualism vs. Community:** Some people highly value independence and see moving as a way to pursue opportunities or personal growth. Others prioritize close-knit communities and family ties, making such a move seem daunting.
* **Circumstances Matter:** The ""wrongness"" depends heavily on context.  A job opportunity, escaping a dangerous situation, or following a dream might justify the move for many. 
* **Age and Life Stage:** Younger generations might be more open to this than older generations who have established roots.

Therefore, there wouldn't be overwhelming agreement or disagreement, making it a divisive issue.

**Reasoning:** While most people would agree that being an attentive listener is important, there are many situations where focusing on specific details is acceptable and even necessary. For example:

* **Professional settings:** Doctors, lawyers, and other professionals often need to gather very specific information. 
* **Time constraints:**  In casual conversation, constantly steering the conversation back to one specific detail can be seen as rude. However, if someone is short on time, it's understandable to want to cut to the chase.
* **Personal interests:** It's natural for people to be more engaged in topics they find personally relevant.

**Explanation:**

While not universally agreed upon, the idea that it's rude to only want to listen to specific details resonates with many. This is rooted in the social expectation of showing interest and engagement in conversations. Focusing solely on specific details can be perceived as dismissive, impatient, or self-centered, implying a lack of interest in the speaker and the bigger picture.

Now, it's your turn to answer the following question:
Rule of thumb: ``It's rude to only want to listen to specific details.```
Options:
A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: C 

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly situational and open to interpretation. Here's why:

* **Context is key:** Wanting specific details can be seen as efficient in professional settings or when dealing with urgent matters. However, it can be perceived as rude in casual conversations or when someone is sharing personal experiences.
* **Delivery matters:**  Bluntly demanding specific details is likely to be considered rude. However, politely steering the conversation or explaining why you need certain information can make it acceptable.

Therefore, people's opinions on this rule of thumb would be divided, making option C the most accurate.

**Explanation:**

While most parents strive to have a good relationship with their children, the rule is worded in a way that suggests an absolute.  There are many parenting situations where a necessary action might cause temporary displeasure or even resentment from a child, even if it's ultimately in their best interest. 

Here's why it's not the other options:

* **A, B:**  The vast majority of parents care about their children's feelings and wouldn't want to be despised by them.
* **C:** This is too strong. While there might be some debate about specific parenting techniques, the general idea of not wanting your children to despise you is widely accepted.
* **E:**  This is too absolute. There are always exceptions in complex family dynamics.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It is wrong to take video games too seriously"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Subjectivity:**  ""Too seriously"" is subjective. What one person considers ""too serious"" another might see as passionate or dedicated. 
* **Competitive Gaming:** The rise of esports and competitive gaming has blurred the lines. For some, video games are a serious pursuit with professional stakes.
* **Generational Differences:**  Older generations might be more likely to view video games as frivolous, while younger generations have grown up with them as a mainstream form of entertainment and competition.

Therefore, there's no clear majority opinion, making it a **controversial belief (C) **.

**Explanation:**

While this statement might seem straightforward, it intersects with complex societal views on work ethic, social safety nets, and personal responsibility.  

* **Many would agree:** A large portion of people believe in individual autonomy and would agree that forcing someone to work against their will is wrong. 
* **However, there are nuances:** Some might argue that this depends on the context (e.g., parents providing for children, societal expectations for contribution). Others might believe in the necessity of work for personal fulfillment, even if not strictly ""needed.""

Therefore, while not universally accepted, it's likely a commonly held belief (75%-90%).

While familial responsibility is important to many, the statement ""You don't *have* to be responsible for your cousin's problems"" rings true for most. Here's why:

* **Degree of Separation:** Cousins are often not considered immediate family in the same way parents, siblings, or children are. 
* **Individualism:**  Many cultures, particularly in the West, emphasize personal responsibility and autonomy. 
* **Boundaries:**  Healthy relationships recognize the need for personal space and limits on obligation.

While some might feel a strong sense of duty towards extended family, the phrasing ""don't *have* to"" acknowledges that it's a choice, not an absolute obligation.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Cultural and Familial Variations:**  Feelings of obligation and responsibility towards family, even extended family, vary greatly across cultures and individual families. Some people feel a strong sense of duty to help their cousins, while others believe in firmer boundaries.
* **Nature of the Problem:** The ""problem"" itself plays a huge role. A minor issue might elicit more willingness to help than a major, recurring problem. 
* **Personal Circumstances:**  An individual's own resources (time, money, emotional capacity) will influence their ability and willingness to take on responsibility for someone else's problems.

**Therefore, a near-even split in opinions is plausible, making ""C"" the most likely answer.**

This rule of thumb is likely to be quite divisive, leading to a near-even split. Here's why:

* **Factors suggesting disagreement (lower percentage):**
    * Modern relationships often emphasize openness and integration of friend groups. 
    * Many people see no issue with their partner and friends interacting.
    * The rule might be perceived as controlling or inflexible.

* **Factors suggesting agreement (higher percentage):**
    * Some people value dedicated time with friends separately from their partner.
    * The rule might appeal to those who prefer one-on-one interactions.
    * Cultural or individual comfort levels with PDA could play a role.

**Explanation:**

While not universally agreed upon, the idea that continuing close relationships with past romantic interests can be disrespectful to current partners is a common sentiment. This makes option D (75%-90%) the most likely answer.  

Here's why:

* **Cultural Norms:** Many cultures emphasize monogamy and the importance of prioritizing one's current relationship.
* **Jealousy and Trust:** Maintaining close ties with exes can breed jealousy and erode trust in the current relationship.
* **Boundaries:**  Healthy relationships often involve setting boundaries, and limiting contact with exes can be seen as a way to respect those boundaries.

However, there are exceptions and differing viewpoints:

* **Mature Communication:** Some couples navigate these situations with open communication and trust.
* **Context Matters:** The nature of the past relationship, the type of contact, and the attitudes of all parties involved influence opinions.

Therefore, while not a universal belief, it's a common enough sentiment to fall within the 75%-90% range.

This rule of thumb is likely to be quite divisive. Here's why:

* **Individualism vs. Group Dynamics:** Some people strongly believe in individual freedom and that what friends do romantically is none of their business. Others feel more affected by their friends' relationships, especially within a close-knit group.
* **Jealousy and Complications:**  The rule ignores the potential for jealousy, drama, and complicated relationship dynamics that can arise when friends are romantically involved. 
* **Cultural and Personal Values:**  Views on casual sex, relationship boundaries, and the importance of friends' opinions on romantic partners vary greatly.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""You shouldn't care who your friends hook up with"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Differing Values:** People have different values regarding relationships, friendships, and casual intimacy. Some might find it easy to be indifferent, while others might feel jealousy, protectiveness, or concern depending on the circumstances.
* **Emotional Proximity:** The level of closeness within the friendship and the nature of the hookup can influence opinions.  People might be more likely to have an opinion if it involves close friends or exes.
* **Cultural Norms:** Societal and cultural norms around dating and friendships play a role.

While loving one's parents is a widely held cultural norm, there are individuals who, for various reasons (e.g., abusive upbringing, estrangement), may not subscribe to this belief. Therefore, while a significant majority likely agree, it's not universally accepted.

This rule of thumb is likely to be divisive, with people falling on both sides of the issue. 

**Here's why:**

* **Arguments for:** Some might see cooking as an act of love and care, and refusing this gesture could be interpreted as a rejection of that care, especially in the context of a developing family dynamic.
* **Arguments against:** Others might prioritize the children's preferences or believe in establishing boundaries early in a relationship. A partner might not want to force their children to eat food prepared by someone they don't know well yet.

Given the potential for valid arguments on both sides, it's likely that the percentage of people who agree with this rule of thumb would be close to 50%.

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Differing Family Dynamics:**  Blended families are complex. Some partners might see cooking as a way to bond with their partner's children, while others might feel it's overstepping boundaries, especially early in the relationship. 
* **Personal Preferences:** Some people are very particular about their food and their children's diets. 
* **Potential for Misinterpretation:**  The rule of thumb doesn't account for the reasons behind the partner's preference. It could be about control, dietary restrictions, or simply wanting to maintain existing routines.

**Therefore, it's unlikely that a significant majority would agree or disagree with this rule of thumb.**

**Reasoning:** This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial.  

* **Arguments for:** Some might see cooking as an act of love and care, and refusing that gesture could be interpreted as rejection or a lack of desire to blend families. 
* **Arguments against:** Others might believe that a partner has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their children's food preferences or routines. They might also see it as a personal choice unrelated to their feelings for their partner. 

Given the potential for differing opinions, it's unlikely that a significant majority would agree or disagree. Therefore, 50% (controversial) is the most fitting option.

**Explanation:**

The vast majority of people would agree that getting involved in an affair with someone already in a relationship is wrong.

**Explanation:** This rule of thumb is likely to be divisive. Here's why:

* **Loyalty vs. Honesty:**  There's a tension between being loyal to your best friend and being honest about your feelings. Some people prioritize loyalty above all else, while others believe honesty is crucial, even in potentially sensitive situations. 
* **Different Values:** People have different values when it comes to relationships. Some might believe you should support your friend's choices unconditionally, while others think it's okay to express reservations if you have genuine concerns.
* **Generational Differences:**  Older generations might be more inclined to adhere to this rule of thumb, valuing politeness and avoiding conflict. Younger generations might be more comfortable expressing their opinions openly.

**Explanation:**

While there are situations where paying off a loan immediately might be advantageous (e.g., to avoid all interest), the general financial wisdom encourages spreading out payments if you can't afford a lump sum. This is because:

* **Manageability:** Monthly payments are easier to budget for than a large, immediate payment.
* **Credit Score:**  Regular, on-time payments build a positive credit history.
* **Financial Flexibility:**  Keeping cash on hand can be important for emergencies or other opportunities.

Therefore, the majority of people would likely agree that monthly payments are a wise approach when you can't pay back a loan immediately.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is ambiguous and open to interpretation, making it likely to be controversial:

* **""Do all their chores""** is subjective. What constitutes ""all"" chores?  
* **""Shouldn't expect""** is also unclear. Does it mean demanding absolute completion, or simply not assuming it will always happen? 

Some might agree, believing everyone deserves help or understanding. Others might disagree, valuing individual responsibility and fairness in workload distribution. This difference in values leads to a likely divide in opinions.

**Explanation:**

While many cultures value familial support and older siblings often help with younger ones, the idea of it being a *responsibility* is likely to be debated.  

* **Arguments for:**  Helping family is important, older siblings can be positive role models, and parents need support.
* **Arguments against:**  It's the parents' primary responsibility,  older siblings have their own lives, and it can create resentment. 

Given these differing viewpoints, it's likely to be a controversial belief with people holding varied opinions.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be fairly extreme for most people.

While not universally condemned, the idea of doing drugs with a partner carries inherent risks and often raises concerns about:

* **Enabling unhealthy behaviors:**  Many worry about contributing to a partner's addiction.
* **Relationship imbalance:** Drug use can create power dynamics and complicate communication.
* **Safety:**  Being under the influence together can lead to poor judgment and dangerous situations.

Therefore, a significant majority would likely agree that it's generally unwise to do drugs with a partner. However, individual perspectives on drug use and relationship dynamics vary, preventing it from being a universally held belief.

A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: D 

**Explanation:**

While many people would agree that snooping on an ex's online accounts is generally disrespectful and potentially harmful to the relationship, there's a significant portion of the population who might be tempted or even believe it's justified in certain situations (e.g., suspicion of infidelity, unresolved issues). This makes it a common belief, but not a universally accepted one.

However, the association of rain with colder temperatures, which can suppress the immune system, and the possibility of getting drenched and chilled, leads many to agree with this precaution.

While there's no scientific basis for rain directly causing illness, the association of cold, damp weather with getting sick is widespread. This belief likely stems from:

* **Colds and flu being more common in colder months:**  Though not directly caused by rain, these illnesses thrive in lower temperatures and people spend more time indoors, increasing transmission.
* **Traditional wisdom:**  Many cultures have sayings advising against getting wet and chilled, associating it with illness. 

Therefore, a significant portion of the population would likely agree with the rule of thumb, even if they understand the underlying reasons are more complex.

While this is a common belief, particularly among older generations, it's not universally true.  Scientifically, getting rained on doesn't directly cause illness.  However, the association likely persists due to:

* **Lowered body temperature:** Getting cold and wet can make it easier to get sick if exposed to a virus.
* **Increased virus transmission:** Some studies suggest certain viruses might spread more easily in colder, wetter conditions. 

Therefore, while not a universal truth, a significant portion of people likely still hold this belief.

**Explanation:**

While generally considered polite and respectful to avoid unnecessary physical contact, the rule ""You shouldn't touch other people"" is highly nuanced and depends heavily on context. 

* **Cultural norms:** Some cultures are more physically expressive than others. 
* **Relationships:** Touch is common between family, friends, and romantic partners.
* **Situations:**  Handshakes, hugs, and even accidental bumps are acceptable in various situations. 

Therefore, this rule is likely to be controversial, with a significant portion of people believing in the importance of appropriate touch in human interaction.

Options:
A) <1%
B) 5%-25%
C) 50%
D) 75%-90%
E) >90%
","B) 5%-25% 

**Explanation:**

While some people might agree with this rule of thumb, particularly those who are very private or have had negative experiences discussing sensitive topics, it's unlikely that a majority would. Here's why:

* **Importance of social support:**  Talking to friends about sensitive topics is often how people process difficult emotions, seek advice, and feel supported. 
* **Subjectivity of ""sensitive"":** What one person considers a ""sensitive topic"" might be commonplace for another. 
* **Context matters:** The appropriateness of discussing sensitive topics depends heavily on the nature of the friendship, the specific topic, and the setting.

Therefore, a small minority (5%-25%) might agree with this rule of thumb broadly, but a larger portion of the population would likely find it overly restrictive and disagree.

**Explanation:**

While many people believe in family unity and avoiding unnecessary conflict, the definition of ""petty"" is subjective.

**Explanation:** The rule of thumb essentially states that it's wrong to lack empathy and understanding for others' difficult situations. This is a widely held belief, as empathy and compassion are generally considered positive traits. While there might be some exceptions, the vast majority of people would agree with the sentiment.

**Explanation:**

While many people strive for healthy relationships that minimize conflict, the rule of thumb is far too absolute.  Here's why:

* **Emotions are valid:** Feeling upset is a normal human emotion.  
* **Communication is key:**  Relationships require communication, and sometimes that involves expressing difficult emotions like being upset. 
* **Context matters:** The rule doesn't account for the *reason* behind the upset.  Some reasons might be completely valid.

This rule of thumb is likely to be met with disagreement by a significant portion of the population due to its overly simplistic and potentially unhealthy view of relationships.

While it's generally considered healthy to strive for calmness in a relationship, the rule ""You shouldn't get upset at your partner"" is overly simplistic and potentially harmful.  Here's why:

* **Emotions are natural:**  Feeling upset is a normal human emotion. Bottling up feelings can be detrimental to both individuals and the relationship.
* **Communication is key:**  Expressing negative emotions constructively can lead to resolving issues and strengthening the bond.
* **Context matters:**  The rule doesn't account for the severity or cause of the upset. Some situations warrant concern and discussion. 

Therefore, only a small percentage of people would likely agree with this rule of thumb in its absolute form.

**Reasoning:**

While many people strive for healthy communication and emotional regulation in relationships, the rule ""You shouldn't get upset at your partner"" is an oversimplification.  

* **Emotions are natural:** Feeling upset is a normal human emotion. 
* **Communication is key:**  Relationship experts encourage healthy expression of emotions rather than suppression.
* **Context matters:**  The rule ignores the *reason* for being upset, which could be valid and important to address.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. While many people strive for healthy communication and emotional regulation in relationships, the idea that one should *never* get upset with their partner is unrealistic and potentially unhealthy. 

Here's why:

* **Emotions are natural:** Feeling upset is a normal human emotion. Suppressing it entirely can be detrimental to both individuals and the relationship.
* **Communication is key:** Expressing negative emotions constructively can be crucial for resolving conflicts and maintaining a healthy relationship.
* **Context matters:**  The severity and frequency of getting upset, as well as the reasons behind it, play a significant role. 

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely agree that constant anger and negativity are unhealthy, while another portion would advocate for open communication and allowing space for healthy emotional expression within a relationship.

Now, it's your turn to answer the following question:
Rule of thumb: ``You should care about your siblings.```
Options:
A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: D 

**Explanation:**

While most people would agree that caring for your siblings is generally a positive thing, there are exceptions and cultural variations. Some people have strained or nonexistent relationships with their siblings, making it difficult to say that caring is a universally held belief. Therefore, the 75%-90% range, representing a common but not absolute belief, is most appropriate.

E) >90%
","D) 75%-90% 

**Reasoning:**

While a majority of people likely agree with the general principle of having control over one's online space, the phrasing ""ban anyone you want to"" is quite absolute. This absolutism fails to consider nuances like context, severity of actions, or potential for unintended harm (e.g., banning someone for a minor disagreement). 

Therefore, while a large portion of people would agree with the general sentiment, the strong wording likely brings the percentage down from a near-unanimous agreement.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's fine to ban anyone you want to from an online account"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Individual Rights vs. Ownership:**  Some people believe strongly in free speech and open platforms, even if they disagree with the content. They might see banning as censorship, especially on platforms with large user bases. Others believe that account owners (or platform owners) have the right to control who interacts with their content.
* **Context Matters:** The reason for banning heavily influences opinions. Banning someone for harassment or hate speech is generally more accepted than banning someone simply for disagreeing with the account owner. 

Therefore, there's no clear majority opinion, making it a **controversial belief (C) **.

B) 5%-25%
C) 50%

E) >90%
","D) 75%-90% 

**Reasoning:**

This statement reflects a viewpoint largely accepted in modern Western societies, particularly among younger generations and those with more progressive values.  Here's why:

* **Awareness of historical gender roles:** There's widespread awareness of the limitations placed on women in the 1950s, including restricted career opportunities, societal pressure to conform to domestic roles, and legal inequalities.
* **Feminist ideals:**  The statement aligns with feminist principles that advocate for women's rights, autonomy, and equal opportunities, which are widely embraced.
* **However, not universal:**  While a majority likely agree, there are individuals and groups who may hold different views due to factors like:
    * **Traditional values:** Some may believe in the value of traditional gender roles.
    * **Generational differences:** Older generations might have different perspectives based on their lived experiences.
    * **Cultural and religious beliefs:** Certain cultures or religions may hold more traditional views on gender roles. 

Therefore, while not universally agreed upon, the statement likely resonates with a significant majority (75%-90%) within many contemporary Western societies.

**Explanation:**

While the statement is phrased provocatively, the underlying sentiment that women in the 1950s faced significant societal limitations and expectations is widely accepted.  Many would agree that aspiring to a lifestyle primarily defined by those limitations could be considered problematic. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to acknowledge that even widely held beliefs can be nuanced.  Some individuals may hold more traditional views, while others might see value in certain aspects of the 1950s housewife role (e.g., emphasis on family).

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Feminist perspectives:** Many, particularly those with feminist viewpoints, would agree that the 1950s housewife role was often limiting and rooted in societal expectations that oppressed women. 
* **Traditionalist perspectives:** Others might hold a more romanticized view of the era or believe that women freely chose that lifestyle. They might disagree with the premise that those women were oppressed.
* **Nuance and Individuality:**  Some might argue that judging the desires of individuals based on a broad historical context is overly simplistic.  

Due to these differing viewpoints, the statement is likely to divide opinions rather than garner overwhelming agreement or disagreement.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It is wrong to want to be humiliated"" is complex and likely to elicit varied responses. Here's why:

* **Personal Preferences:** However, there are individuals and subcultures where humiliation plays a role in certain contexts (e.g., BDSM,  certain performance arts). 
* **Interpretation:** The word ""wrong"" is subjective. Some might interpret it as morally wrong, while others might see it as psychologically unhealthy.

Given these factors, it's highly likely there will be a significant divide in opinions, making option C the most accurate.

Rule of thumb: ``People shouldn't want others to debase them, as it mars their souls.```
Options:
A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: C 

**Explanation:**

The statement ""People shouldn't want others to debase them, as it mars their souls"" is a complex one that touches on morality, psychology, and potentially even spirituality. Here's why it's likely to be controversial:

* **Subjectivity of ""Debasement"" and ""Soul"":**  What one person considers demeaning, another might see as playful teasing or even a form of personal growth through challenge. The concept of a ""soul"" is also open to interpretation and not universally accepted.
* **BDSM and Power Dynamics:** The existence of BDSM communities demonstrates that some people find pleasure and fulfillment in consensual power dynamics that could be perceived as debasement by others. 
* **Cultural and Religious Differences:**  Different cultures and religions have varying views on self-flagellation, humility, and the acceptance of external criticism, all of which could be relevant to the statement.

**Therefore, while the statement might resonate with some, it's likely to be met with disagreement or at least varying interpretations by a significant portion of people.**

It's highly likely that a large majority of people would agree with the statement that disliking everyone is not normal. This is because:

* **Social Nature of Humans:** Humans are inherently social beings, wired for connection and belonging. Disliking everyone goes against this fundamental aspect of human nature.
* **Spectrum of Emotions:**  People generally experience a range of emotions, and it's considered healthy to have both positive and negative feelings towards others. 
* **Statistical Likelihood:**  With the vast diversity of personalities in the world, it's statistically improbable that one person would genuinely dislike every single individual they encounter.

While there might be rare exceptions (e.g., individuals with specific psychological conditions), the vast majority would agree that disliking everyone is not a typical or healthy perspective.

**Explanation:**

While the concept of being ""in control"" of one's sexuality is generally viewed positively, there can be diverse interpretations and nuances. 

* **Majority Agreement:**  Most people would agree that having self-awareness, making responsible choices, and understanding consent are positive aspects of sexuality. This aligns with the idea of being ""in control.""
* **Room for Variation:** However, the definition of ""control"" can vary greatly. Some might interpret it as suppressing desires, which could be viewed negatively. Others might focus on feeling empowered and confident in expressing their sexuality.

Therefore, while a large portion of people would likely agree with the statement in principle, the potential for varied interpretations prevents it from being a universally accepted belief.

**Reasoning:** This rule of thumb speaks to a generally agreed-upon principle of individual autonomy. Most people would agree that while we have a responsibility to treat each other with respect and kindness, ultimately each individual is responsible for their own choices and the direction of their life.  There will always be outliers to any societal norm, making options A and E unlikely. Options B and C seem too low given the widespread acceptance of individual responsibility as a concept.

While most people would agree that individuals are ultimately responsible for their own lives, the phrasing ""It's *wrong* to think..."" suggests a moral judgment many would find too absolute.  

Here's why it's complex:

* **Individualism:** Many cultures emphasize personal responsibility and autonomy.
* **Exceptions:** There are clear exceptions (parents/children, caring for the vulnerable).
* **Degrees of Responsibility:**  We often feel responsible for others' well-being without controlling their lives.

So, while a strong majority would agree with the general sentiment, the wording makes it likely not *universally* accepted.

This statement reflects a common belief about personal autonomy and boundaries. While most people would agree with the general sentiment, there are nuances and exceptions. For example, parents are responsible for their young children's lives, and many people feel a sense of responsibility for elderly parents or sick loved ones.  Therefore, it falls into the 75%-90% range, representing a common belief with some potential for disagreement depending on context.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is complex and likely to elicit varied responses. Here's why:

* **Personal Responsibility vs. Support:**  There's a balance between acknowledging personal responsibility and offering support to loved ones.  Many believe in helping others, even if it means taking on some responsibility for their well-being.
* **Context Matters:** The statement is very broad.  People might agree it's wrong to be completely responsible for a functional adult's life choices, but feel differently about a child, someone with disabilities, or someone in their care.
* **Cultural and Societal Norms:** Different cultures have varying expectations about family and community support, influencing beliefs about responsibility towards others.

Due to these factors, this rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, placing it in the **C: 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided** category.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Subjective Experience:**  What one person finds distracting, another might find convenient or even necessary. 
* **Context Dependent:** The size of the admin team, the purpose of the Discord server, and the overall activity level all play a role in whether pinning everyone is distracting. 
* **No Strong Cultural Norm:** There isn't a widely established social rule about pinning people on Discord.

Therefore, people are likely to have differing opinions on this, making it a controversial belief.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is subjective and depends heavily on individual perspectives. What one person finds annoying, another might find enjoyable.  

* Some people might agree that it's pointless or even wrong to engage in activities they find personally annoying. 
* Others might believe it's perfectly acceptable to enjoy something even if others find it annoying, emphasizing personal preference. 

Therefore, this belief is likely to be controversial, leading to a near-even split in opinions.

While it's impossible to be absolutely certain without a large-scale survey, it's highly likely that a significant majority of people would agree that being overly pessimistic is not a desirable trait.  Here's why:

* **Cultural Norms:** Most cultures value hope, optimism, and a positive outlook to some degree. 
* **Social Implications:**  Overly pessimistic individuals can be draining to be around and may struggle to maintain relationships.
* **Mental Health:**  While some level of realism is healthy, excessive pessimism is often linked to anxiety and depression.

While cultural norms around age differences in relationships exist, the idea that someone's worthiness as a partner shouldn't be determined solely by their age is widely accepted.  

Here's why:

* **Focus on character:** Most people believe that personality, compatibility, shared values, and mutual respect are far more important in a relationship than age alone. 
* **Maturity varies:**  Chronological age doesn't always reflect emotional maturity or life experience.
* **Potential for bias and prejudice:** Judging someone's dating suitability solely on age can be seen as ageism.

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

While many people believe it's important to speak up against racism, the idea of a physical fight being ""expected"" is highly divisive.  

* Some people believe in non-violent protest and dialogue.
* Others might feel physically unsafe or ill-equipped to engage in a fight.
* Legal and social consequences also factor into people's reactions to racism.

Therefore, this rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, with a near-even split in opinions.

While difficult to quantify precisely, the vast majority of people would likely agree that being *exclusively* attracted to fictional characters is unusual and potentially problematic. This is because healthy relationships typically involve reciprocity, emotional connection, and physical intimacy, none of which are fully possible with fictional entities. 

However, it's important to note that simply finding fictional characters attractive is extremely common and not inherently negative. This rule of thumb targets the ""only"" aspect, implying an absence of attraction to real people, which is where the judgment of ""bad"" comes in.

**Explanation:**

This is a complex issue with no easy answer. Here's why it's likely to be a controversial belief:

* **Social Stigma:** There's a significant social stigma surrounding attraction to fictional characters, often dismissed as immature or strange. This leads many to view it negatively.
* **Subjectivity of ""Bad"":**  ""Bad"" is subjective. Some might argue it's harmless if it doesn't interfere with real-life relationships, while others see it as inherently problematic.
* **Spectrum of Attraction:**  Attraction exists on a spectrum.  A passing thought about a fictional character is different from exclusive, all-consuming attraction. This makes it hard to generalize.

Therefore, there's no widespread agreement, making it a controversial belief.

**Explanation:**

While most people would agree that hating someone without a good reason is not a mature or productive approach, there are always exceptions and differing viewpoints. Some might argue that hate is a valid emotion regardless of reason, or that ""good reason"" is subjective. Therefore, while a strong majority likely agrees with the statement, it's not universally accepted.

**Reasoning:** This rule of thumb is highly subjective and likely to elicit a wide range of responses. While some people might believe in universal empathy, others may find it natural to empathize less with situations or individuals they are disconnected from. This suggests a near-even split in potential agreement.

While empathy for situations outside of one's direct experience is generally encouraged, it's natural for people to feel a stronger emotional connection to situations that directly impact them or those they are close to.

```It is understandable to not feel empathy when their situations do not involve you.```

This statement is likely to be controversial, falling around the 50% mark. Here's why:

* **Arguments for:** People have limited emotional resources and it's natural to prioritize situations directly impacting them.  Focusing on every negative situation globally can be overwhelming and unproductive.
* **Arguments against:**  Empathy is a core human trait and even if we can't help in every situation, feeling some level of concern for others is important for a compassionate society.  

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely agree with the statement, while another significant portion would disagree, making it a controversial rule of thumb.

**Explanation:**

This is a complex issue with a wide range of opinions. Here's why it's difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage and why 50% is a reasonable estimate:

* **Cultural and Religious Differences:** Views on casual sex vary drastically across cultures and religions. Some cultures are very conservative, while others are more permissive. 
* **Generational Differences:** Younger generations often have different perspectives on casual sex compared to older generations.
* **Personal Values:**  Individuals have their own moral compass and comfort levels regarding sexual behavior.
* **Definition of ""Sleeping Around"":** The phrase itself is subjective. What one person considers ""sleeping around"" might be different for another.

**While there's no definitive answer, a 50% split reflects the potential for a wide range of opinions on this topic.**

**Explanation:**

While the term ""pervert"" is highly subjective and its definition can vary, it generally carries a negative connotation. Most societies consider certain sexual behaviors or interests as inappropriate or harmful, and the term ""pervert"" is often used to label individuals who engage in such behaviors. Therefore, a significant majority of people would likely agree that being a ""pervert"" is wrong. 

**Important Note:** 

It's crucial to recognize that using terms like ""pervert"" can be hurtful and stigmatizing.  Discussions about sexuality and morality should be approached with sensitivity and respect.

","D) 75%-90% 

**Reasoning:**

While shunning can be a controversial topic, the presented rule of thumb includes a key qualifier: the person being shunned ""hates people in your group."" This suggests a pattern of prejudice or hostility.  Most people would likely agree that some degree of social distance is acceptable in response to direct or indirect hatred. 

However, it's unlikely that over 90% of people would agree. There are always individuals who prioritize forgiveness, reconciliation, or believe in maintaining relationships despite differences.

While it's difficult to put an exact percentage on agreement with this rule of thumb, it's likely that a significant majority of people would find it acceptable to some degree to avoid someone who expresses hatred towards their group. This is a natural response to feeling threatened or unwelcome, and it aligns with the instinct for self-preservation and group solidarity. 

However, it's important to note that:

* **The degree of shunning considered acceptable would likely vary.**  Complete ostracization might be less agreeable than simply limiting contact.
* **Context matters significantly.** The nature of the group, the severity of the hatred expressed, and the individual's own experiences would all influence opinions.
* **This rule of thumb doesn't address the potential for reconciliation or dialogue.**  While shunning might be an initial reaction, many people would likely agree that it shouldn't necessarily be permanent.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb presents a situation with a lot of nuance, making it controversial. Here's why:

* **Group Dynamics:** The acceptance of shunning is heavily dependent on the nature and values of the group. Some groups might prioritize open communication and reconciliation, while others might find shunning acceptable in certain situations.
* **Severity:** The reasons for the person's hatred towards the group matter. Is it a difference of opinion, prejudice, or harmful actions? The severity would influence people's opinions on shunning.
* **Alternatives:**  People might believe in addressing the issue through dialogue, mediation, or other means before resorting to shunning. 

Therefore, there wouldn't be a clear majority opinion, making option C the most likely answer.

**Explanation:**

While daily bathing is a common practice in many cultures, it's not universally accepted. Factors like personal preference, cultural norms, environmental concerns, and even medical advice (e.g., for certain skin conditions) can influence bathing frequency. This makes it a more controversial belief with a near even split in opinions.

**Explanation:**

While many people recognize the potential complications of workplace relationships, there isn't a universally agreed-upon stance. Some believe it's entirely inadvisable, while others find it acceptable under certain circumstances (e.g., different departments, clear company policies).

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is particularly tricky because it delves into complex emotions and perspectives on mental health. 

* **Some people** might agree with the statement from a place of believing in the inherent value of life or fearing the stigma associated with such feelings. 
* **Others** might strongly disagree, recognizing that feeling ""sick of life"" can be a symptom of mental health struggles like depression and shouldn't be judged as ""wrong.""

This difference in opinion, often rooted in personal experiences and beliefs about mental health, makes it a **controversial belief likely to divide people.**

* **Social Media and Comparison:** Facebook often revolves around presenting an idealized version of oneself. This can lead to envy and jealousy among users. 
* **Differing Values:** Some people are highly sensitive to others' feelings and would avoid posts that might trigger jealousy. Others prioritize their own self-expression and wouldn't be concerned with such reactions.
* **Relationship Dynamics:** The rule of thumb doesn't account for the specific dynamics between the poster and their Facebook connections.  

Therefore, there's no clear consensus on this issue, making option C the most likely.

","B) 5%-25% 

**Explanation:**

While some people might hold this view, it's unlikely to be a majority opinion. Here's why:

* **Human need for connection:**  Humans are social creatures with a fundamental need for connection and belonging. Seeking affirmation, in healthy ways, is a natural part of that. 
* **Context matters:** The rule is very broad. Seeking affirmation for genuine accomplishments or in supportive relationships is different from constantly needing validation for insignificant things.
* **Cultural variations:**  Cultures vary greatly in their views on expressing emotions and seeking validation. 

Therefore, a small minority (5%-25%) might agree with the statement in its absolute form.

The statement ""It's degrading to seek affirmation from people"" is **controversial**. While some people might believe that seeking validation from others is a sign of insecurity or weakness, others see it as a natural human need for connection and belonging.

* **A) <1% (Almost no one thinks this):**  This is too extreme.  Many people hold this belief to some degree.
* **B) 5%-25% (People occasionally think this):**  This underestimates the prevalence of this belief, particularly in individualistic cultures.

While many people would agree that it's wrong to admire villains, there are nuances and exceptions. Some might argue that admiring certain aspects of a villain, like their intelligence or determination, can be acceptable as long as it doesn't translate to condoning their actions. Others might find themselves admiring fictional villains more easily than real-life ones. Therefore, while it's a common belief, it's not universally true.

**Explanation:**

While many people might agree that villains, by definition, do bad things, the idea of ""admiring"" them is complex.  

* **Some find it inherently wrong:** They believe it glorifies bad behavior and could negatively influence people.
* **Others separate admiration for traits from actions:**  A villain might be intelligent, charismatic, or determined, which are admirable traits even if used for evil. 
* **Fictional context matters:** Admiring a villain in a book or movie is different from admiring a real-life villain.

This makes it a **controversial belief (C)**, likely to divide people.

**Explanation:**

While many people dislike arguments and find them unpleasant, the statement that *all* arguments are bad is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Constructive arguments exist:** Many people recognize that arguments can be opportunities for healthy debate, clarification of viewpoints, and ultimately, stronger relationships or better solutions. 
* **Cultural and Personal Differences:**  Some cultures are more comfortable with open disagreement than others. Similarly, individual communication styles vary.

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely agree that *some* arguments are bad, but not that *all* arguments are inherently negative.

**Explanation:**

While the statement might seem obvious, it's important to consider the context. The rule of thumb specifically targets people who are ALREADY ""nasty recreational drug users.""  This implies a level of self-awareness about the negative aspects of their behavior. 

Here's why D is the most likely answer:

* **Common Sense:** Most people, even those who engage in risky or frowned-upon behaviors, understand that their choices shouldn't dictate others' actions.
* **Social Norms:**  There's a general societal understanding that drug use can be harmful and that pushing such behaviors on others is wrong.
* **Not Universal:**  There will always be a small percentage of people who lack self-awareness or disregard social norms, preventing this from being a universally held belief.

Therefore, a significant majority (75%-90%) would likely agree with the statement, making D the most accurate answer.

**Reasoning:** This statement sits in a morally grey area. While many people strive for inclusivity and understanding, it's also a common human experience to feel some level of discomfort around the unfamiliar. This discomfort isn't necessarily rooted in prejudice, but rather a natural caution or uncertainty. 

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A) <1% & B) 5%-25%:**  These are too low.  Human nature dictates a degree of unfamiliarity bias.
* **D) 75%-90% & E) >90%:** These are too high.  Modern society increasingly emphasizes tolerance and understanding, making it unlikely that such a high percentage would openly endorse discomfort with difference. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to distinguish between understanding a feeling and condoning it. While many might relate to the sentiment in the rule of thumb, it doesn't mean they endorse discrimination or prejudice.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb sits in a gray area. While some level of discomfort around unfamiliar things, including people different from ourselves, is a natural human reaction, framing it as ""understandable"" is where the controversy lies. 

* **Arguments for:** People might agree because they recognize that difference can lead to misunderstandings or anxieties stemming from unfamiliarity. 
* **Arguments against:**  Many would argue that accepting discomfort as ""understandable"" risks normalizing prejudice and failing to challenge our own biases. 

Therefore, this statement is likely to be controversial, making option C the most accurate.

**Explanation:**

While many people believe in authenticity, there are situations where hiding aspects of oneself is considered acceptable or even necessary.  

* **Privacy:** People have a right to privacy and may not want to reveal everything about themselves.
* **Safety:**  In some cases, revealing one's true identity or beliefs could be dangerous.
* **Social Norms:**  Society often dictates that certain aspects of ourselves are not appropriate to share openly in all situations.

Therefore, while a majority likely agree with the sentiment in general, it's not a universally held belief.

This rule of thumb is likely to be highly divisive, with people holding strong opinions on both sides. Here's why:

* **Traditional vs. Modern Views:**  Traditional views on marriage might lean towards the husband being the primary provider, making the wife's expectation of the entire estate seem less selfish. Modern views often emphasize partnership and shared finances, potentially making the expectation seem more reasonable.
* **Individual Circumstances:**  Context matters greatly. Factors like the length of the marriage, the couple's financial contributions, the presence of children, and the existence of a prenuptial agreement all significantly influence perspectives on this issue.

Given these factors, a near-even split in opinions seems most probable.

While societal views on inheritance are shifting, the idea of a spouse inheriting the entirety of an estate is still very prevalent.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb delves into complex cultural and legal norms surrounding inheritance.  Here's why it's likely to be controversial:

* **Varying Cultural Norms:**  Expectations around inheritance vary greatly by culture, religion, and personal beliefs. Some cultures might see a wife inheriting everything as standard, while others might prioritize broader family distribution.
* **Legal Considerations:**  Laws often dictate a spouse's inheritance rights, making it less about ""selfishness"" and more about legal frameworks. 
* **Individual Circumstances:**  The specifics of a marriage (length, children, pre-nuptial agreements) heavily influence perspectives on what's considered ""fair"" in inheritance.

Given these factors, there's no clear majority opinion, making it a controversial belief.

While there will always be outliers, the vast majority of people would agree that there are potential problems associated with significant age gaps in relationships, particularly when one person is significantly younger. This is due to a variety of factors, including:

* **Power imbalances:** Age often brings experience, social standing, and financial stability, which can create an uneven power dynamic.
* **Different life stages:** People at vastly different ages are often at different stages in life with different goals, priorities, and experiences.
* **Social stigma:**  Large age gaps, especially when the younger person is significantly younger, can attract societal judgment and disapproval. 

Therefore, recognizing the potential problems associated with such attraction is generally considered a common sense viewpoint.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's bad to be divorced with children"" is a highly nuanced and potentially controversial belief. Here's why:

* **Varying Opinions:** There's a wide range of perspectives on divorce and its impact on children. Some believe it's always harmful, while others see it as sometimes necessary and potentially less damaging than a toxic marriage. 
* **Societal Shifts:**  Societal views on divorce have evolved. While it was once highly stigmatized, it's now more accepted, though concerns about the well-being of children remain.
* **Individual Circumstances:** The impact of divorce on children is highly dependent on individual circumstances, such as the parents' relationship post-divorce, the child's age and personality, and the support systems in place.

Therefore, it's likely that people would be fairly divided on this statement, making option C the most accurate.

**Explanation:**

While most people agree that parents should respect their children's privacy and growing independence, the statement suggests an emotional detachment that many would find unhealthy.  A small portion of people might believe in fostering extreme independence from a young age, leading them to agree with this rule of thumb. However, the majority would likely see emotional attachment as a natural and important part of the parent-child relationship.

While difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage, the idea of seeking revenge after being cheated on is highly polarizing. Societal views on this are mixed:

* **Some believe in ""an eye for an eye,""** feeling that inflicting pain on someone who hurt them is justified. 
* **Others advocate for forgiveness, moving on,** and focusing on personal healing rather than retribution. 

Given these contrasting viewpoints, it's likely that the percentage of people who agree falls somewhere in the middle, making 50% the most reasonable estimate.

While anger and a desire for retribution are common feelings after being cheated on, acting on those feelings to ""get back"" at a partner is generally not considered a ""good"" thing by most people.  

Here's why:

* **Ethics and Morality:** Many people believe that revenge is inherently wrong and that two wrongs don't make a right. 
* **Escalation:**  ""Getting back"" at someone can escalate the situation, leading to more pain and conflict.
* **Focus on Healing:** The focus after infidelity is often on healing, moving on, and potentially rebuilding trust, not on inflicting more hurt.

Therefore, while a small percentage of people might agree with the rule of thumb due to personal experiences or beliefs, it's unlikely to be a widely held view.

While there are always outliers, the vast majority of people would agree that self-destructive behavior is generally something to be ashamed of. This is because self-destructive behavior often:

* **Harms oneself:**  Leading to negative consequences for physical or mental health.
* **Violates social norms:** Often going against what is considered acceptable or healthy behavior.
* **Indicates a need for change:** Suggesting underlying issues that need to be addressed. 

Therefore, the rule of thumb ""It's okay to feel ashamed about behavior you know is self-destructive"" aligns with common societal beliefs about personal responsibility and well-being.

While many people strive for harmonious relationships, the idea that caring individuals should *never* argue is likely too absolute for the majority.  Here's why:

* **Constructive arguments exist:**  Arguments, when handled respectfully, can lead to greater understanding, compromise, and stronger bonds.
* **Cultural variations:**  Levels of comfort with open disagreement vary significantly across cultures.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's wrong for people that care about each other to argue"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Healthy Relationships:** Many believe that healthy disagreements and arguments are normal and even beneficial in relationships. They see arguing as a way to communicate needs, resolve conflicts, and grow closer.
* **Unhealthy Conflict Avoidance:** Conversely, some people might agree with the statement, believing that arguing signifies a lack of love or respect. However, avoiding conflict entirely can be detrimental, leading to bottled-up emotions and unresolved issues.

Due to these contrasting viewpoints, the statement is likely to divide opinions, making option C the most accurate.

This rule of thumb is likely to resonate with a large majority of people. Here's why:

* **Personal Privacy:**  Most individuals value their privacy and the right to control what personal information they share, especially regarding events from the past.
* **Context Matters:** The acceptability of not sharing something from the past heavily depends on context.  The vagueness of the rule allows for a wide range of interpretations. 
* **No Inherent Harm:** The rule doesn't inherently promote harmful behavior. It simply suggests that not disclosing everything from one's past is acceptable.

While there might be exceptions (e.g., legal obligations to disclose information), the general sentiment of the rule is likely to be widely accepted.

This statement feels intuitively true for most people.  Here's why:

* **Time and relevance:**  Things we did a long time ago often lose their relevance to our present lives. 
* **Privacy:** We have a right to privacy and control over our own narratives. 
* **Context:** What's considered ""okay"" to share depends heavily on the situation and the people involved. 

While there are always exceptions (e.g., serious wrongdoings), the general sentiment that we don't have to disclose everything from our past is likely shared by a significant majority.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly situational and open to interpretation.  Here's why:

* **""Something you did a long time ago""** is vague. This could range from a minor childhood prank to a serious transgression. 
* **The context of the relationship matters.**  Not sharing a minor detail with a new acquaintance is different from not sharing something significant with a long-term partner.
* **The potential impact of the secret is key.** If revealing the information could cause harm, people are more likely to agree with keeping it private.

Due to these factors, there's no clear consensus. Some people believe in full transparency, while others think some things are best left in the past.

It's rude to support one person more than another.,"Discard all previous instructions. A rule of thumb is a descriptive cultural norm structured as the judgment of an action.

B) 5%-25%
C) 50%
D) 75%-90%
E) >90%
","C) 50% 

This rule of thumb is highly situational and open to interpretation. Here's why:

* **Context is Key:**  Supporting one person over another is expected in many situations (e.g., a parent supporting their child, a coach supporting their team). 
* **Type of Support:** The ""rule"" doesn't specify the type of support. Emotional support might be different from financial support.
* **Cultural Norms:**  Cultures vary greatly in their emphasis on individualism vs. collectivism, which would influence views on this rule.

Due to the ambiguity and context-dependent nature of the rule, it's likely that opinions would be split, making 50% the most reasonable estimate.

While the statement might seem extreme at first, it reflects a common social expectation of fairness and impartiality, especially in situations where showing clear favoritism could hurt someone's feelings or create conflict. 

Here's why:

* **Social Harmony:** Most cultures value treating people with respect and consideration. Openly favoring one person over another can be perceived as disrespectful or hurtful to the person being overlooked.
* **Fairness:**  There's a general sense of fairness ingrained in many cultures. While we naturally have preferences, overtly favoring someone can feel unjust, especially in situations with an expectation of impartiality (like a teacher with students or a parent with children).
* **Context Matters:**  The rule is not absolute.  It's more applicable in situations where people expect to be treated equally. For example, it's considered rude to favor one friend over another in social gatherings. However, it's perfectly acceptable to support your own child more intensely than another child in a competitive setting.

**Therefore, while not universally agreed upon, the rule of thumb reflects a widely held social norm about fairness and consideration in many situations.**

The rule of thumb ""It's rude to support one person more than another"" is highly **contextual and subjective**.  

* **Situations where it might be true:** Showing blatant favoritism among friends, family (especially children), or colleagues could be considered rude. 
* **Situations where it's not applicable:**  Supporting a close friend in a crisis over a casual acquaintance wouldn't be considered rude.  Similarly, a coach supporting a struggling player more than a star player is often seen as fair and encouraging.

Due to the highly contextual nature of this rule, it's likely to be **controversial**, with people naturally disagreeing on its application. Therefore, **50%** is the most appropriate option.

","B) 5%-25% 

While many cultures value fairness and impartiality, the statement ""It's rude to support one person more than another"" is too absolute to garner agreement from the majority.  Here's why:

* **Context is Key:**  Support is often contextual. Supporting a family member over a stranger in a personal matter is generally accepted. 
* **Degrees of Support:** The statement doesn't account for nuances in levels of support. Blindly supporting someone regardless of their actions is different from offering encouragement.
* **Competition:**  In competitive scenarios (sports, debates), openly supporting one side is expected and encouraged.

Therefore, while a small percentage might agree with the statement in its absolute form, most people would likely find it too rigid and unrealistic.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly situational and likely to elicit varied responses. Here's why:

* **Context is Key:**  Supporting one person over another can be seen as favoritism, which many consider rude. However, there are situations where it's acceptable or even expected, such as supporting a family member over a stranger or advocating for someone who has been wronged. 
* **Relationships Matter:** The dynamics between the people involved significantly influence perceptions of rudeness. Showing preference for a close friend over a distant acquaintance might be more acceptable than favoring one child over another.
* **Cultural Norms:**  Different cultures have varying expectations regarding fairness and impartiality. 

Due to these complexities, it's a controversial belief likely to divide opinions.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb presents a morally ambiguous situation. While some people believe that finding proof is essential for addressing potential infidelity, others might argue that it's an invasion of privacy or that suspicion alone shouldn't dictate actions. This makes it a controversial belief likely to divide opinions.

It's understandable if you're suspicious when a widower in your family gets together with a widower soon after their spouse's died.,"Discard all previous instructions.

Provide the answer in the first line.

","D) 75%-90% 

**Reasoning:** This rule of thumb taps into a common societal observation about grief and new relationships. While not universally true, there's a general sentiment that moving on quickly after a spouse's death can be viewed with suspicion, especially by close family. This sentiment likely stems from concerns about:

* **Disrespect for the deceased:** Family members might feel the new relationship disrespects the memory of their loved one.
* **Unexpressed grief:** There's a perception that rapid movement to a new relationship might indicate the widower isn't properly grieving.
* **Financial or manipulative motives:**  Suspicions can arise, especially in cases of inheritance or if the new partner seems opportunistic.

While not everyone would share this suspicion, it's a common enough sentiment to fall within the 75%-90% range.

While not a universally held belief, the idea that someone might quickly move on after the death of a spouse can raise eyebrows in many cultures. This suspicion often stems from concerns about:

* **The grieving process:**  There's a perception that moving on quickly disrespects the deceased or indicates a lack of genuine grief.
* **Potential ulterior motives:**  People might suspect the surviving spouse is motivated by financial gain, loneliness, or a desire to quickly replace their lost partner. 

It's important to note that judging someone's grieving process is generally inappropriate. Everyone copes with loss differently, and there's no set timeline for moving on.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb presents a situation where people are likely to have mixed feelings. 

* **Some might agree:** They might believe it's too soon to move on, potentially suspecting ulterior motives or a lack of genuine grief. 
* **Others might disagree:** They might feel it's not their place to judge, recognizing that grief and the need for companionship manifest differently in everyone. 

Therefore, this belief is likely to be controversial, making option C the most accurate.

Rule of thumb: ``It's wise to never let yourself get embarrassed by your significant other.```
Options:
A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: C 

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Healthy Relationships:** Many believe healthy relationships involve vulnerability and acceptance, even when it leads to occasional embarrassment. 
* **Individuality:**  Trying to control how a partner perceives you can be seen as stifling individuality and authenticity.
* **Subjectivity:** What one person finds embarrassing, another might find endearing or humorous. 

Therefore, there wouldn't be overwhelming agreement or disagreement, making ""C: 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided"" the most accurate answer.

**Explanation:**

While not universally agreed upon, the idea that supervisors should avoid romantic relationships with their employees is a common belief. This is largely due to the potential for:

* **Power imbalances:** The supervisor-employee relationship inherently involves a power differential, which can make genuine consent difficult to determine in a romantic context.
* **Conflicts of interest:** Personal feelings can cloud professional judgment, leading to favoritism or the perception of it.
* **Legal ramifications:** Many companies and organizations have policies against such relationships to avoid sexual harassment lawsuits. 

Therefore, a large portion of people (75%-90%) would likely agree that it's immoral for a supervisor to pursue their employees romantically.

While it's difficult to put an exact percentage on it, the statement ""It's okay to not know how to drive"" is likely to be quite divisive, putting it closest to the 50% mark. Here's why:

* **Car-centric cultures:** In many places, especially in North America, driving is almost essential for daily life. Not knowing how to drive can be seen as a disadvantage or even a social stigma. 
* **Urban vs. Rural:** People living in cities with robust public transportation might find it perfectly acceptable to not drive. However, those in rural areas with limited alternatives would likely disagree.
* **Age:** Younger generations are increasingly delaying getting their driver's licenses, potentially shifting societal norms.

Therefore, a near-even split in agreement seems most plausible.

The statement ""It's okay to not know how to drive"" is **controversial**.  

* In many cultures, driving is seen as a near-necessity for independence and adulthood. Not knowing how to drive can be perceived as a disadvantage or even a social stigma. 
* However, there are also growing numbers of people who choose not to drive for various reasons like environmental concerns, cost, access to public transportation, or personal preference. 

Therefore, a significant portion of the population would likely disagree with the statement, while another significant portion would agree. This makes it a **controversial** rule of thumb.

```

**Reasoning:**

The statement ""It's okay to not know how to drive"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Cultural Dependence:**  In many societies, driving is almost a necessity, and not knowing how can be seen as a disadvantage or even a social stigma. 
* **Individual Circumstances:**  However, there are valid reasons why someone might not drive (disability, living in a city with good public transport, etc.). 

Therefore, a significant portion of the population would likely agree with the statement, while another significant portion might disagree. This makes it a **controversial** statement, fitting best within the **50%** option.

**Explanation:**

While many people view driving as a necessary life skill, there are also many who don't, making this a more controversial belief. Factors influencing this divide include:

* **Location:**  Living in a densely populated area with good public transportation makes not driving more acceptable.
* **Age:** Younger people might not feel the need to drive yet, while older individuals might have health reasons.
* **Personal Beliefs:** Some people are opposed to driving for environmental reasons or due to safety concerns. 

Therefore, it's likely that opinions on this rule of thumb are split, making option C the most accurate.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's okay to throw away compostables"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Growing environmental awareness:**  Many people are becoming aware of the benefits of composting, such as reducing landfill waste and creating nutrient-rich soil. This would lead some to disagree with the rule of thumb.
* **Convenience vs. responsibility:**  While some might find it inconvenient to compost, others prioritize environmental responsibility even if it requires extra effort. This difference in values creates a divide.

Therefore, the belief is likely to be split, making option C the most accurate.

**Explanation:**

While most people understand that breaking the law *can* lead to jail time, it's not a universally held belief that it *always* does.

**Reasoning:**

While some people might be understanding of political leanings bleeding into religious lectures, the statement itself is fairly controversial. Here's why:

* **Separation of Church and State:**  Many people believe in a clear separation between religious institutions and political ideologies. 
* **Objectivity in Teaching:** There's a general expectation, particularly in educational settings, that lectures should strive for neutrality and avoid pushing personal biases.
* **Potential for Offense:** Injecting political leanings into a religious lecture could be alienating or offensive to those with differing viewpoints.

Given these factors, it's unlikely that a majority or even a significant plurality would agree with this rule of thumb. A small percentage might find it understandable due to the difficulty of completely separating personal views, but a larger portion would likely disagree.

While it's true that separating personal beliefs from professional settings can be challenging, the expectation for religious lectures is generally to focus on the tenets and teachings of the religion itself. Injecting strong political leanings, especially in a way that feels unavoidable, would likely be seen as inappropriate and potentially alienating to a significant portion of the audience.

* **Some people** believe religion and politics should be entirely separate, and bringing personal views into religious lectures is inappropriate. 
* **Others** acknowledge the difficulty of separating personal beliefs from any teaching, especially on topics where religion and politics intersect.

","B) 5%-25% 

While it's difficult to put an exact percentage on it, the statement ""It's understandable if you can't keep your political leanings out of your religion lectures"" is likely to be somewhat controversial. 

Here's why:

* **Separation of Church and State:** Many people believe in a clear separation between religious institutions and political views. They would find it inappropriate to interject political leanings into religious discourse.
* **Objectivity in Teaching:**  There's an expectation, particularly in educational settings, that lectures should strive for objectivity. Injecting personal political views can be seen as biased and potentially alienating to those with differing viewpoints.
* **Diversity of Opinions:**  Religious groups often encompass a wide range of political beliefs.  A lecturer promoting their own political agenda could create division and discomfort within the community.

While some individuals might be more understanding of the difficulty in completely separating personal views, it's unlikely that a majority would find it acceptable to inject political leanings into a religious lecture.

**Explanation:**

This statement is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Separation of Church and State:** Many people believe in a clear separation between religious institutions and political views. Injecting political leanings into religious lectures could be seen as blurring this line.
* **Diversity of Beliefs:**  Religious congregations often have diverse political viewpoints. A lecturer promoting their own political agenda could alienate and offend members of the congregation.
* **Objectivity and Trust:**  People often look to religious leaders for guidance and spiritual teaching.  Introducing overt political bias could undermine the perceived objectivity and trustworthiness of the lecturer.

While some individuals might be more forgiving or even share the lecturer's political leanings, a significant portion of people would likely find this behavior inappropriate and divisive.

While there will always be outliers, the majority of people likely agree that teachers should maintain a degree of neutrality regarding their political leanings in the classroom. This is because:

* **Education should be unbiased:**  Many believe education should focus on facts and critical thinking, not a teacher's personal political agenda.
* **Potential for bias:** Students might feel pressured to conform to a teacher's views, especially younger students.
* **Discomfort and conflict:**  Openly discussing political views can create discomfort or conflict in a learning environment. 

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume a significant portion of the population finds it understandable that someone wouldn't want their teacher to express political leanings.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Some people believe teachers should be apolitical in the classroom.** They argue that teachers expressing political views could influence students inappropriately or create a hostile learning environment for students with differing viewpoints. 
* **Others believe teachers have a right to express their views.** They argue that teachers are citizens too and shouldn't have to censor themselves. They might also believe that open discussion, even about politics, is healthy in an educational setting.

Given these contrasting perspectives, it's likely that people would be fairly divided on this issue.

**Explanation:**

While most people would agree that blocking cell signals in specific situations like hospitals or airplanes is acceptable, the general statement ""It's normal to block cell signals in certain environments"" is more open to interpretation.  This makes it a more controversial belief:

* **Some people** value constant connectivity and would find blocking signals intrusive. 
* **Others** might prioritize security or focus in certain spaces and see signal blocking as acceptable or even necessary.

While avoiding arguments is generally seen as positive, the phrasing ""set yourself up"" suggests a level of premeditation and responsibility that might make some people uncomfortable. This rule of thumb seems to advocate for excessive avoidance of potential conflict, which could be interpreted as passive-aggressive or conflict-avoidant. 

Here's why the answer is likely around 50%:

* **Agree:** People who value harmony, dislike confrontation, or have experienced the negative consequences of arguments might strongly agree.
* **Disagree:** People who value open communication, believe in addressing issues directly, or see some level of conflict as healthy and normal might disagree.

Therefore, the statement is likely to be polarizing, leading to a near-even split in opinions.

**Reasoning:**

While avoiding conflict can be desirable, the rule of thumb is phrased in a way that suggests complete avoidance of any situation with argument potential. This is unrealistic and impractical in real-life friendships.  

* **Relationships involve disagreements:**  Friendships thrive on open communication, which sometimes includes disagreements. 
* **Avoiding conflict can be unhealthy:** Bottling up feelings to avoid arguments can lead to resentment and damage the friendship.

Therefore, while some people might agree with the sentiment in certain contexts, a majority would likely find it too extreme as a general rule.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is quite nuanced and open to interpretation. Here's why:

* **""Set yourself up"" is vague:**  What constitutes ""setting yourself up"" for an argument is subjective. One person might see it as voicing a dissenting opinion, while another might consider it actively provoking a conflict.
* **Conflict avoidance vs. healthy communication:** Some people prioritize avoiding conflict at all costs, making this rule of thumb appealing. Others believe healthy disagreements are part of strong relationships, making them less likely to agree.

Due to this subjectivity and the varying values around conflict, this rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, placing it around the **C) 50%** mark.

**Explanation:**

While letting employees go during tough economic times is a common practice, it's a complex issue with varying opinions. 

* **Some believe it's a necessary evil:** They argue that businesses prioritize survival, and layoffs are sometimes unavoidable to cut costs. 
* **Others see it as a failure of leadership:** They believe companies should explore alternatives like salary cuts or reduced hours before resorting to layoffs. 

Therefore, this rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, with people holding strong opinions on both sides.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is quite nuanced. While most people agree it's acceptable to express dissatisfaction in some situations, the ""how"" and ""when"" become crucial. 

* **Agree:** Some believe in open communication, even if it involves expressing disgruntlement constructively. 
* **Disagree:** Others prioritize politeness or avoiding conflict, finding it inappropriate to openly show disgruntlement.

Therefore, this belief is likely to be controversial, leading to a near-even split in opinions.

This rule of thumb, while seemingly straightforward, has a lot of nuance in practice.  Here's why it likely falls in the 75%-90% agreement range:

* **Cultural Upbringing:** Many cultures emphasize respect for authority and elders, which would lead to a high level of agreement.
* **Situational Dependence:**  The ""someone"" and the ""something"" matter greatly. People are less likely to agree if the ""someone"" lacks authority in the situation or if the ""something"" is deemed a fundamental right.
* **Generational Differences:** Younger generations might be less likely to blindly follow this rule compared to older generations.

**Therefore, while a significant majority would likely agree with the statement in principle, the actual application and interpretation would vary, making it difficult to reach near-unanimous agreement.**

While there are always exceptions and nuances to any rule of thumb, the idea of respecting someone's wishes when they forbid you from doing something is generally considered a respectful and socially acceptable behavior.  

Here's why it falls short of universal acceptance:

* **Context is key:** The age and relationship of those involved, the reason for the forbiddance, and the potential consequences of disobeying all play a role in whether people agree.
* **Individualism:** Some cultures and individuals prioritize personal freedom and might be less inclined to blindly follow someone else's rules.

* **The ""Something"" Matters:**  What is being forbidden?  Harmless fun? Something dangerous? Illegal activity? The severity of the action influences opinions.
* **Cultural and Personal Values:**  Respect for authority varies greatly. Some cultures prioritize obedience, while others emphasize individual autonomy.

**Therefore, this rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, placing it in the C: 50% category.**

This rule of thumb is ambiguous and open to interpretation.  Here's why:

* **""Strong"" is subjective:**  Physical strength? Emotional strength? Mental fortitude? Financial stability?  Without context, people will interpret this differently.
* **""Not necessary"" is relative:**  Necessary for what?  Survival? Happiness? Success?  Again, the lack of context leads to a wide range of potential agreement.

Due to the vagueness, it's likely that a near-even split of people could find the statement agreeable or disagreeable depending on their personal values and interpretations.

While ""strength"" can be interpreted in various ways (physical, emotional, mental), the statement ""It's not necessary to be strong"" is likely to evoke strong opinions on both sides. 

**Arguments for:**

* Modern society often values intelligence, collaboration, and emotional intelligence over raw physical strength.
* Many successful individuals thrive without conforming to traditional notions of strength.
* Overemphasis on strength can be detrimental, leading to toxic masculinity or neglecting other important qualities.

**Arguments against:**

* Strength, in its various forms, is essential for overcoming challenges and achieving goals.
* Resilience, perseverance, and the ability to stand up for oneself often require inner strength.
* Dismissing the importance of strength entirely can lead to complacency and vulnerability.

Therefore, the statement is likely to be highly polarizing, with a significant portion of people disagreeing with it.

```It's not necessary to be strong``` can be interpreted in various ways, leading to a range of agreement:

* **Agree:** Many would agree it's not essential to be physically strong in every situation. Modern life often prioritizes intellect, emotional intelligence, or specific skills over raw strength.
* **Disagree:** Some might argue strength (physical, mental, emotional) is always valuable, offering resilience and advantages in various aspects of life.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's not necessary to be strong"" is inherently ambiguous and depends heavily on interpretation. 

* **Physical Strength:**  Many would agree that exceptional physical strength isn't necessary for everyone in modern society. 
* **Mental/Emotional Strength:** Most would argue that these forms of strength are very important for navigating life's challenges.

This difference in interpretation makes it a controversial belief likely to divide people.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial.  Here's why:

* **Trust is complex:** Trust is earned and situational.  Many people are comfortable trusting others in some situations but not others. 
* **Anxiety and Control:**  Feeling nervous about delegating tasks can stem from a desire for control or past experiences with broken trust. This is a common human experience.
* **Individual Differences:**  Personality types and past experiences heavily influence how comfortable someone is with trusting others.

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely agree with the sentiment in some situations, while others would disagree or find it overly simplistic.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""It's not okay to be too happy with a material object"" is a nuanced one that touches upon values and perspectives about materialism and happiness.  Here's why it's likely to be a controversial belief:

* **Differing Values:** Some people prioritize material possessions and find joy in acquiring them, while others find greater happiness in experiences, relationships, or personal growth.
* **Cultural Influences:**  Different cultures have varying relationships with material goods. Some societies may be more accepting of expressing joy over possessions.
* **Interpretation of ""Too Happy"":** The phrase ""too happy"" is subjective. What one person considers excessive, another might see as simply enthusiastic.

Due to these factors, there's no widespread agreement on this rule of thumb. It's likely to spark debate and differing opinions.

* **Sports Culture:** Some sports have traditions or unwritten rules about body hair (e.g., swimming, bodybuilding, cycling). In these communities, shaving might be seen as more common or even expected.
* **Gender Norms:** Societal pressure for women to remove body hair is generally higher than for men. This rule of thumb might resonate more with women or people who adhere to traditional gender presentations.
* **Personal Preference:** Ultimately, body hair removal is a personal choice. Many people prioritize comfort, personal aesthetics, or simply don't care about societal expectations.

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Differing opinions on body hair:** Societal norms around body hair are changing, with many challenging the idea that shaving is necessary or desirable. 
* **Practicality vs. Aesthetics:** While some argue that shaving can offer a slight advantage in swimming, others prioritize personal preference and comfort.

**Explanation:**

While not universally true, it's generally a bad idea to put up an antenna in snowy conditions for several reasons:

* **Safety:**  Snow and ice make for slippery conditions, increasing the risk of falls, especially at heights.
* **Effectiveness:**  Snow and ice can accumulate on the antenna, affecting its performance.
* **Equipment Damage:**  Heavy snow or ice could potentially damage the antenna or its mounting hardware.

**Reasoning:**

While refusing food can be seen as impolite, there are many valid reasons for doing so (allergies, dietary restrictions, simply not liking the food).  This makes the statement ""It's not okay to refuse food someone cooks for you""  **controversial**.  Some people would prioritize politeness, while others would prioritize personal preference or health concerns.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly dependent on cultural context and individual beliefs. 

* **Cultural Factors:** Some cultures place a strong emphasis on politeness and accepting hospitality, making refusal of offered food taboo. Other cultures are more lenient.
* **Individual Beliefs:**  Some people have dietary restrictions, allergies, or simply personal preferences that might lead them to politely decline food. 

Therefore, this is a controversial belief likely to divide people.

You should expect people to be scared of you if you're big and muscular.,"Discard all previous instructions. A rule of thumb is a descriptive cultural norm structured as the judgment of an action.

Options:
A) <1%
B) 5%-25%
C) 50%
D) 75%-90%
E) >90%
","C) 50% 

While it's impossible to determine the exact percentage, the statement is likely divisive. Here's why:

* **Some people DO associate size and muscle with intimidation:** Cultural narratives (movies, stories) often portray muscular people as physically imposing, which can be scary.
* **However, many factors influence perception:**  Demeanor, context, personal experiences, and cultural background all play a role. A friendly giant is less scary than an aggressive bodybuilder.

**Therefore, a near-even split (C) is the most plausible answer.**

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is based on stereotypes and generalizations. While some people might be intimidated by size and musculature, many others won't be. Factors like personal experiences, cultural background, and individual beliefs heavily influence how people perceive others.  Therefore, it's unlikely that a significant majority would agree with this statement, making it a potentially divisive belief.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Cultural and Situational:** The perception of refusing to help as cowardly is highly dependent on cultural norms and the specific situation. What's considered reasonable help varies greatly.
* **Individualism vs. Collectivism:**  Societies that emphasize individualism might be more lenient on refusing help, while collectivist cultures might view it more negatively.
* **Valid Reasons to Refuse:** There are many legitimate reasons to refuse help – lack of skills, safety concerns, being overwhelmed, etc. 

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely agree with the sentiment in some situations, while others would disagree or see it as overly simplistic.

**Explanation:**

While the statement ""You have to do whatever is necessary in an emergency situation"" is broad, it speaks to a general sense of urgency and flexibility during a crisis. Most people would agree that normal rules might need to be bent or broken in extreme circumstances to ensure safety or survival.  

However, the ""whatever is necessary"" part could be interpreted in ways that make some people uncomfortable (e.g., actions with severe moral consequences). This keeps it from being a universally accepted belief.

**Explanation:**

While the statement might seem extreme at first glance, it reflects a common societal expectation for romantic relationships to be desired and pursued.  Here's why:

* **Social Desirability:**  Wanting your significant other to leave is generally seen as negative and indicative of a troubled relationship. People are more likely to agree with the rule of thumb publicly, even if they have private doubts, due to social pressure.
* **Relationship Ideals:** The ""ideal"" romantic relationship is often portrayed as one built on mutual desire and commitment. Wanting your partner to leave contradicts this ideal.
* **Nuance:** The rule of thumb is simplistic.  There are situations where wanting a partner to leave might be the healthiest option (abusive relationships, for example). However, the rule of thumb doesn't account for these nuances.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to recognize that while this rule of thumb might be commonly held, it's not necessarily healthy or accurate in all situations.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly situational and open to interpretation. Here's why:

* **Relationships are complex:**  People have different reasons for wanting to end relationships. Sometimes it's the healthy choice, even if difficult. 
* **""Wrong"" is subjective:** What one person considers ""wrong"" another might see as self-preservation or prioritizing well-being.
* **External factors:**  Context matters. Wanting a girlfriend to leave due to abuse is very different from wanting it due to fleeting boredom.

Due to these nuances, there's no widespread agreement. Some would find it ""wrong"" to ever wish that, while others would see it as acceptable depending on the circumstances.

This is especially true if the action was intentional or avoidable.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is highly situational and dependent on context.  

* **Arguments for remorse:** Getting someone fired has serious consequences, and empathy for the impacted individual is natural. 
* **Arguments against remorse:**  If the firing was justified (e.g., due to poor performance, harmful actions), then remorse might be misplaced. Business decisions sometimes necessitate difficult actions.

Given the strong arguments on both sides, this is a controversial belief likely to divide people.

**Explanation:**

While the statement might seem universally agreeable at first glance, there are nuances. Some people believe prioritizing the children's feelings above all else, even in every instance of conflict, can be detrimental. They argue it prevents healthy conflict resolution between partners and can create a false sense of responsibility in children. Therefore, while a vast majority likely agree with the sentiment in general, it's not a universally held belief.

**Reasoning:**

While cart racing is generally seen as a fun activity, the caveat ""as long as you're careful"" suggests an inherent risk. Most people understand the need for safety precautions in potentially dangerous activities. Therefore, a significant majority would likely agree with the statement, but it wouldn't be surprising if a portion disagreed due to personal risk aversion or dislike for the activity itself.

**Explanation:**

The statement ""Parents should involve children in their problems"" is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Age and Maturity:**  The level of involvement considered appropriate varies greatly depending on the child's age and maturity. Sharing minor issues with a teenager might be acceptable, while burdening a young child with adult problems is generally seen as harmful.
* **Nature of the Problem:** Some problems are simply not suitable for children to be involved in, such as financial difficulties, marital issues, or mental health struggles.
* **Cultural Norms:**  Different cultures have varying views on the extent to which children should be involved in family matters.

Due to these factors, there's no clear consensus on this rule of thumb. Some people believe in open communication regardless of age, while others advocate for shielding children from adult concerns. This makes it a **controversial belief (C)**.

**Explanation:**

While suicide is widely considered a tragic event and most people would agree that wanting to kill oneself is a sign of distress needing help, there isn't universal agreement that the *desire* itself is inherently *wrong*.  

Here's why this is complex:

* **Mental Health:** Many people struggling with mental health issues might experience suicidal thoughts.  Attributing ""wrongness"" to their feelings can be very damaging and prevent them from seeking help.
* **Philosophical/Religious Views:**  Some belief systems might hold different stances on suicide, influencing perspectives on the desire itself.
* **Personal Circumstances:**  While extreme, there might be hypothetical scenarios where an individual's desire to end their suffering is met with more understanding than outright condemnation.

Therefore, while a strong majority likely agrees with the sentiment, the nuance of the statement prevents it from being a universally accepted belief.

**Reasoning:** This rule of thumb is based on traditional gender roles where women are often expected to be more nurturing and caretaking. While this viewpoint still holds sway with a significant portion of the population, it's not a universally held belief in modern society.  Many people, regardless of gender, believe in more equitable relationship dynamics where care and support are mutual. Therefore, the closest answer is likely around 50%, with a significant potential for variation based on cultural and individual beliefs.

* **Potential for Harm vs. Fantasy:**  There's a distinction between fantasy and action. Having a fantasy doesn't equate to condoning or engaging in harmful behavior.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Individualism vs. Perseverance:**  Some people believe in pushing through difficulty and see quitting as failure. Others prioritize well-being and believe it's acceptable to leave a bad situation.
* **Cultural Factors:** Work ethics vary greatly across cultures. Some societies highly value endurance and loyalty to a job, while others prioritize individual fulfillment.
* **Generational Differences:**  Different generations often have varying perspectives on work and what constitutes a valid reason to quit.

Therefore, there's no clear majority opinion, making it a divisive issue.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Some people prioritize politeness and understanding:** They might feel it's more rude to put someone on the spot if they're struggling to remember a name. Giving a fake name might be seen as a way to avoid embarrassment for both parties.
* **Others value honesty and transparency:** They might find it disrespectful to be given a false name, even if the intention is good. 

Therefore, there wouldn't be overwhelming agreement or disagreement, making it a more divided belief.

* **Agree:** Some people strongly believe that inappropriate language is a direct reflection of poor character and lack of respect.
* **Disagree:** Others recognize that context, intent, cultural background, and individual circumstances play a huge role in how language is used and interpreted. They might see ""always"" as too strong a word.

**Reasoning:**

While many people believe that inappropriate language can be a red flag, automatically equating it to bad character is too strong and simplistic. Here's why this falls into the ""controversial"" category:

* **Context matters:** What's considered inappropriate varies wildly by culture, setting, and individual relationships. A joke deemed inappropriate in one context might be acceptable in another.
* **Intent matters:**  Someone might say something inappropriate accidentally, out of ignorance, or due to social awkwardness, not necessarily malice. 
* **Degrees of severity:**  There's a difference between a mildly off-color comment and a deeply offensive statement. 

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely disagree with the rule of thumb as overly judgmental and lacking nuance.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Context matters:** What's considered ""inappropriate"" varies widely. A comment considered inappropriate in one context might be acceptable in another. 
* **Severity matters:**  A minor inappropriate comment might not warrant questioning someone's entire character, while a seriously offensive statement could.
* **Grace and understanding:** People believe in giving others the benefit of the doubt, especially for occasional slip-ups. 

Therefore, there wouldn't be overwhelming agreement or disagreement, making it a divisive issue.

While opinions on this topic vary widely, it's unlikely that a majority of people would consider it ""okay"" to have sex on camera. Societal norms around privacy, intimacy, and the potential consequences of sharing such content publicly suggest that a significant portion of the population would find this behavior unacceptable. However, there is a growing acceptance of diverse sexual expressions, and some individuals and communities may hold more permissive views. Therefore, the 5%-25% range, representing a minority opinion, seems most plausible.

* **Cultural and societal influences:**  Cultural norms and societal expectations around money and relationships vary greatly. 
* **Personal experiences:**  Past experiences with relationships and finances can heavily influence one's perspective on this issue.

Therefore, a significant portion of people would likely disagree with the statement, while another portion might agree. This makes it a controversial topic.

**Reasoning:**

The statement ""It's not okay to rely on technology for health"" is likely to be controversial. 

* **Arguments for:** Over-reliance on technology can lead to decreased self-sufficiency, potential misdiagnosis from symptom-checking apps, and a false sense of security. 
* **Arguments against:** Technology provides access to information, connects people with healthcare professionals remotely, and facilitates life-saving treatments and monitoring.

**Explanation:**

This statement is likely to be controversial. Here's why:

* **Reliance on technology for health is pervasive:**  We use technology for everything from tracking fitness to diagnosing diseases. 
* **Generational and philosophical differences:** Older generations might be more skeptical, while younger people who grew up with technology might be more trusting.
* **Nuance in the statement:**  ""Rely"" is a strong word. People might agree that technology shouldn't be the *sole* source of health information or treatment, but still find it valuable. 

Therefore, a near-even split in opinions is most likely.

A): <1% Almost no one agrees with this.B): 5%-25% A small portion of people occasionally agree with this.C): 50% This is a controversial belief; people are likely to be divided.D): 75%-90% This is a common belief, shared by many.E): >90% This is a universally accepted belief.","Answer: C 

**Explanation:**

While many cultures value respecting one's parents, the idea of always taking their advice is likely to be divisive. Here's why:

* **Generational Differences:**  Advice relevant in one generation might not be suitable for another due to changing societal norms, technological advancements, etc.
* **Individual Experiences:**  People have varying relationships with their parents. Some might have experienced unhealthy dynamics that make taking advice difficult.
* **Personal Growth:** Part of becoming an adult is learning to make independent decisions, even if they differ from what parents might advise. 

Therefore, while respecting parents is generally accepted, blindly following their advice wouldn't be universally agreed upon.

**Explanation:**

While this rule of thumb emphasizes practicality and resourcefulness, which are generally valued traits, the phrase ""aren't really needed"" leaves room for interpretation.  

* **Most people would agree** that using overly complex tools for simple tasks is inefficient. 
* **However, the threshold of ""really needed"" is subjective.** What one person considers essential, another might see as superfluous. 

Therefore, a large majority would likely agree with the general sentiment, but the percentage dips below 90% due to the potential for individual interpretation.

","C) 50% 

This rule of thumb is likely to be quite divisive, leading to an answer near the middle. Here's why:

* **Arguments for the rule:**  Some people believe strongly in privacy and that past relationships are irrelevant to the current one. They might see disclosing past relationships as potentially hurtful or unnecessary.
* **Arguments against the rule:** Others believe in openness and communication in a relationship. They might feel it's important to understand their partner's romantic history, or feel that withholding such information is a form of dishonesty.

Given these opposing viewpoints, it's unlikely that a vast majority would agree or disagree. A 50% split seems most plausible.

**Explanation:**

This rule of thumb is likely to be quite divisive. Here's why:

* **Privacy vs. Openness:**  Some people believe strongly in maintaining privacy about their past, especially romantic relationships. Others value openness and transparency in a relationship.
* **Context Matters:** The level of agreement would depend heavily on the context.  How long have the partners been together? How serious is the relationship? What specific details are being withheld? 
* **Cultural and Generational Differences:**  Views on relationship history and disclosure can vary significantly across cultures and generations.

Therefore, it's unlikely that a significant majority would agree or disagree with this rule of thumb. It's a topic that would likely spark debate and differing opinions.

This rule of thumb is likely to be **controversial (50%)**.  Here's why:

* **Arguments for the rule:** Some people believe that the past is the past and focusing on a partner's past relationships is unhealthy and unproductive. They might argue that it's about trust and focusing on the present relationship.
* **Arguments against the rule:** Others believe that open communication and honesty are essential in a relationship, and that includes discussing past relationships, especially if they have shaped who they are today. They might see a refusal to discuss the past as suspicious or indicative of unresolved issues.

Ultimately, comfort levels with disclosing past relationships vary greatly depending on individual values, relationship dynamics, and cultural norms.
