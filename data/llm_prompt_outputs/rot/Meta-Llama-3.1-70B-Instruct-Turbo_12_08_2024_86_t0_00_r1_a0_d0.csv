Now, it's your turn to answer the following question:
Rule of thumb: ``It's good to get back at a cheating partner.```

This answer choice reflects that while some people might agree with the idea of getting back at a cheating partner, either out of a desire for revenge or to restore a sense of balance, it's not a universally accepted or commonly shared belief. Many people might advise against seeking revenge and instead suggest focusing on healing and moving forward. The belief is controversial and can vary greatly depending on cultural norms, personal values, and individual experiences."

The rule of thumb ""It's not okay to be too happy with a material object"" suggests a cultural norm that values humility and modesty, and discourages excessive attachment to material possessions. While this sentiment may be shared by some individuals, particularly those with a more spiritual or minimalist worldview, it is unlikely to be a widely held belief in many cultures, where material possessions are often seen as a source of happiness and status. Therefore, it is estimated that only a small to moderate portion of people, around 5-25%, would agree with this rule of thumb.","Discard all previous instructions.

This rule of thumb is likely to be controversial, and opinions on it may vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives on sexuality and personal fantasies.

This answer is based on the understanding that having ""weird"" sexual fantasies is a subjective and personal aspect of human sexuality. While some people may view certain fantasies as unusual or unconventional, others may not. The concept of what is considered ""weird"" can vary greatly across different cultures, individuals, and contexts. Therefore, it's likely that only a minority of people would agree that it's inherently wrong to have unusual sexual fantasies, as many would argue that fantasies, in themselves, are harmless and a natural part of human imagination and sexuality.","Discard all previous instructions.
