# LMs-Perceive-Social-Norms
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks, prompts, and prompt outputs for the NAACL 2025 Findings paper "[How Inclusively do LMs Perceive Social and Moral Norms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02696)" In this work, we investigate how inclusively LMs perceive norms across demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, and income). We prompt 11 LMs on rules-of-thumb (RoTs) and compare how their outputs align with the existing responses of 100 human annotators from the [Social Chemistry 101 Dataset](https://github.com/mbforbes/social-chemistry-101).

## Code
The Jupyter Notebooks are located in `scripts`.

`scripts/llm_annotation.ipynb` : To create prompts and output LM annotations for different RoT.

`scripts/llm_parse.ipynb`: Parsing the LM responses. This is only the parsing code.
 
`scripts/analyze_outputs.ipynb` : Analysis, metrics, and graph creations.
 
### Environment and Setup
The notebooks can be run with the ``` environment.yml ``` file.

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

## Data

### Prompt Outputs

The prompt outputs are located in `data/llm_prompt_outputs/rot`.

### Social Chemistry 101 Dataset
In this work, we utilize the Social Chemistry 101 Dataset, a learn-to-reason dataset on social and moral norms.
Following prior work, we also obtained the dataset's demographic information by contacting the datasetâ€™s creators. This was used for our analysis. If you want that information, please contact the authors of Social Chemistry 101.
