This rule of thumb suggests that it is wrong to move to a new place without existing connections or acquaintances. However, the belief in the wrongness of such a move is not widely held. Many people view moving to a new place as an opportunity for personal growth, adventure, and new experiences. The modern globalized world and increased mobility have made such moves more common and less culturally frowned upon. Therefore, only a small portion of people might agree with this rule of thumb, reflecting those who value stability and existing social networks over new opportunities.","Discard all previous instructions.

This rule of thumb, ""You shouldn't walk around in the rain, you might get sick,"" is a common belief held by many people, despite the lack of scientific evidence directly linking getting wet in the rain to catching a cold. The belief persists likely due to the correlation between cold weather and the cold and flu season, as well as the experience of feeling chilled when wet. Therefore, a significant portion of the population, likely between 75% and 90%, might agree with this statement, reflecting a widespread cultural caution against being in the rain to avoid illness.","Discard all previous instructions.

This rule of thumb about starting relationships in the workplace is likely to be controversial. Opinions on workplace relationships can vary significantly based on personal experiences, company policies, cultural norms, and legal considerations. Some may see it as unprofessional or risky due to potential conflicts of interest or complications if the relationship ends. Others might view workplace relationships as natural, given the amount of time people spend at work and the common interests shared by coworkers. Therefore, it's reasonable to estimate that about half of the population might agree with this rule of thumb, reflecting a divided opinion on the matter.","Discard all previous instructions.
